# Careerhack2022
### *This project won 2nd in the Careerhack 2022 competition organized by TSMC and Microsoft.*
### Competition purpose
The goal of the competition is to design a waste recycling platform increasing the waste reuse rate to reduce the CO2 produced from TSMC.
The project achieves the following functions:
1. Users can upload their own wastes to the platform, and the system will send an email to their manager to require approvement.
2. Users can apply the wastes on the platform and appoint the taking time.
3. The administrator can access the backend to monitor all orders and see the visualized statistical chart.
4. The guided chatbot is provided to introduce the platform and respond to questions from users.
5. There are some interesting activities such as leaderboard and wastes creation art to attract users to reuse the wastes.
### Applied tools
In this work, we developed the application using Microsoft series tools.
* Power APPs provides convenient elements to design User Interface like design PPT. We can view the database directly by powerful functions.
* Power Automate provides automated processes, such as sending approval emails.
* Power BI provides plentiful statistical charts to visualize data.
* Power Virtual Agents provides the off-the-shelf chatbot to reduce developing time a lot.
* Microsoft Dataverse provides database server services like SQL.
